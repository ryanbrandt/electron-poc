# React/Electron Frontend

### Development

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start` - Start react server on localhost:3000
- `yarn electron` - Start electron server, which will consume from localhost:3000

We can develop as we would with a normal react app on localhost:3000, or develop with the electron window. The final result is ultimately the same.

- `yarn electron-dev` - Start react server, wait for server to go up, start electron server
